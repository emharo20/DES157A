            <h2>Project Report: User Testing</h2>

            <p>For my final project report and expert opinion, I decided to do a user testing of my blackjack game. I chose to do the usability report because I wanted my game to be intuitive to the users and to also improve it through what the users really need and want instead of what I think would be interesting to add for the game. Overall, my user testing showed that sometimes less is more when it comes to intuitive user design and how much one change in the design can affect how a user interacts with the product. To understand what my users were testing, here is the <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/e5529fba-2767-4ae8-bc9c-2b6ba9e51f30-b001/?fullscreen&hints=off">prototype</a> they used.</p>

            <p>For my user testing, I had two different users who fit into my target audience test out my game. For context, my target audience for my project are university students who have either never played blackjack or have casually played blackjack. My first user in this round of testing was a third year student majoring in English. They have played blackjack before, though they knew it better through the name 21, but needed a refresher on the rules since it had been a while since they played. My second user was also a third year university student, but was a psychology and chicano studies double major. This user had never played blackjack before so was experiencing the game for the first time.</p>


            <p>For this user test, their task was to just play the game. By this I mean that they would need to play blackjack via the prototype I gave them. They weren't really given any more instructions besides that, but were encouraged to be honest with their reactions and to not be afraid to voice any concerns they might have found while playing the game.</p>


            <p>The testing of the game did not go as expected. When the users began to play the game, they were a bit confused about who was playing and how to play. When they saw the cards dealt for each player, they believed that it was the screen that decided how many players were going to play and didn't realize those were the cards that they were dealt. On top of that, when they went to play the actual game, they did not notice the total points message on the top of the page and believed that the view of the other player's cards was the queue of what card was next after they hit, and, at first, believed it was telling them that the other player was currently playing. They also did not notice the gray “Quit” and “Rules” button at the bottom corners.</p>


            <p>Besides those observations, the rest of the game went on smoothly. They were able to get the mechanics of how the hit and stand works, and, after they discovered what the dealt cards screen was, were able to use the turn play buttons properly. They actually continued to play the game after the testing was over, which was a good sign that they enjoyed the game. They didn't feel the need to press the grayed out “played” button, which was great as it did signal to them that that button was no longer usable. They found no complaints about the final scoring screen and found it very clear at the end.</p>


            <p>They personally didn't have many questions about the prototype itself. The main questions they had was about the background of the project and the concept itself. These questions included “How do I play the game?”, “Why was it called 'Lazy Blackjack'?”, and “Did you create all of this? How?”. These questions didn't really affect the functionality of the product, but were fun little questions I enjoyed hearing.</p>


            <p>This user testing helped me realize both the good and bad aspects of my redesign. It allowed me to realize that removing the timed waiting section was a good move, but I had to add some type of introduction before showing them the cards that there are supposed to be 2 players playing. I think the best way to solve this problem is to include a form for the player to enter their name. This way it will allow the user to customize their experience while also forewarning them that it is a two player game. I also think that I will be removing the second player’s card view while the other player is playing as that caused a lot of confusion for both users while testing. I will also be continuing the idea of matches as that seemed to be an aspect that both users enjoyed.</p>
