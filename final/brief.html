            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>I have decided to continue to work on my <strong><a href="../studio3/index.html">Game On!</a></strong> project and I will most likely focus on the visual design of it and the UX/UI functionality of it.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <p>For the visual design, I plan on editing it to look more like the design comp I made in the beginning. An the element of the comp that I want to specifically include is the opposing player's card view, with a facing card and a downward facing card. This was an aspect of the game the I personally enjoy and I think would add an element of player's strategy to my game.</p>

            <p>As for the UX/UI functionality aspect of this project, I plan on fixing the player's turn aspect of the game. As will be stated in the next section, all of the players that were playing the game were confused by this aspect, and I'd like to make it more intuitive for the players.</p>

            <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
            <p>For this section, I decided to user test my current game to see where to go with the functionality of my game. I had three total users test my game, all of whom were part of my target audience, a college student who has either never played blackjack before or is a casual player. One user was a 4th year student majoring in math who hasn't played blackjack. My next user was a 2nd year student majoring in aerospace science and engineering who has never played blackjack. My last user is a 3rd year student majoring in electrical engineering who has played blackjack before, but needed a refresher of the rules.</p>

            <p>From their experience, they found the rules very clear and easy to understand. They were a bit confused about the part of having a face up card and a face down card as the game did not feature that aspect. I will admit that was a statement not needed with the current game, but hopefully will be featured in my next iteration. They did find the turn system a bit confusing at first was they were not aware that they had to pass the device in order to play correctly. After they discovered that, the playability went smoother, but was still an unnecessary hurdle to jump through.</p>

            <p>Some minor comments made by individual users. One user commented that they thought the game had more than one round to play, which could be a cool feature to include in the next iteration. Another user mentioned that they were confused as to why the game would continue if they had already busted and thus have automatically lost. I think that is a feature that will either need to be adjusted, or explained better in the rules. A different user didn't comment this, but I did notice that they were able to distinguish when the other user had busted based on the sound affect that played, so that will need to change if I want in increase player strategy.</p>
