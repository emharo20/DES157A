                <h3>Blackjack Rules</h3>
                <p>The goal of this game is to have a hand that is equal to or less than <strong>21</strong>. You are given two cards, one facing up for all players to see and one facing down for only you to see. You sum up the values of your two cards and then have the option to <strong>hit</strong> or <strong>stand</strong>. If you <strong>hit</strong>, you are given another card to add to your value, but be careful. If you go over 21, you automatically lose. If you are satisfied with the hand you have, you can <strong>stand</strong>, which basically means you finish your turn and the next player gets to play (or it ends the game if you are the final player to stand).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>K, Q, J have a value of 10</li>
                    <li>A can have a vaule of either 11 or 1</li>
                    <li>Rest of the cards have their face value</li>
                </ul>
