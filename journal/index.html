                    <p>I found the guidelines <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Medium</a> gave about overlays very helpful in how to style them and how to properly use them. I think a reason why I found them so helpful is because some of the things they suggested to do are or to avoid are some of the things that irritate me when they are not followed. The biggest example of this would be the suggestion to make them user-initiated. I absolutely hate it when a website suddenly gives me a pop-up out of nowhere as it disturbs the flow of the site and also gets me out of the moment. This is especially true when the close button is hard to locate and is just stuck there until I find it. Both of these problems are things that Medium suggests against and it's understandable too. The design and flow of the website should keep the user in mind and be user-centric. When a random pop-up appears and the close button is hard to find, it eliminates the user's agency and makes the site less user-centric.

                    <p>I agree with the tips given by the <em>Medium</em> article "<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>." All of these tips, from what questions to start out with to where to place the labels and example texts, are all things that help people fill forms out, and in fact are tips that I gave to my work once before. For context, I work as a computer room consultant (CRC) and in order to get promoted we have to take a test. The majority of the test was taken through a Google form and, in my opinion, was not well formatted. The test was too long and was all in one page. Although the questions were divided into sections, they did not divide them into different pages and overloaded us with too much information with no clear indication when that test was going to end.</p>

                    <p>I think that the form I filled out the best exemplifies these practices was the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> sign up page. It started out simple with just asking your email, to begin to create your account, and then your personal information. Afterwards, it starts to ask questions about your career and what you are looking for, but also gives you the option to skip that process and fill it in later.</p>
