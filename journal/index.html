                    <h2>Form Design Research</h2>

                    <p>I agree with the tips given by the <em>Medium</em> article "<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>." All of these tips, from what questions to start out with to where to place the labels and example texts, are all things that help people fill forms out, and in fact are tips that I gave to my work once before. For context, I work as a computer room consultant (CRC) and in order to get promoted we have to take a test. The majority of the test was taken through a Google form and, in my opinion, was not well formatted. The test was too long and was all in one page. Although the questions were divided into sections, they did not divide them into different pages and overloaded us with too much information with no clear indication when that test was going to end.</p>

                    <p>I think that the form I filled out the best exemplifies these practices was the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> sign up page. It started out simple with just asking your email, to begin to create your account, and then your personal information. Afterwards, it starts to ask questions about your career and what you are looking for, but also gives you the option to skip that process and fill it in later.</p>
