                    <h3>Part One</h3>
                    <img src="images/in-loving-memory.jpg" alt="'In Loving Mermory'">
                    <figccaption>"In Loving Memory", created by Emma Haro, 2021</figccaption>
                    <p>The image I chose for the project to explain in more detail is my piece titled “In Loving Memory”. This piece is a memento about my grandpa who passed away on October 16, 2020 and represents my relationship with him as a whole. The piece is full of symbolism and is an image that needs to be looked at closely in order to get its full meaning. Starting at the bottom, the shadow represents the past relationship with my grandpa. My grandpa had been there with me from the moment I was born and not only watched me grow up but also helped raise me. That shadow represents the little girl he helped raise, but also represents how I'll forever be that little girl by his side. Above the shadow is our current relationship. Our silhouettes are grown up to our present day bodies, but he is no longer physically around, which is why my silhouette is detailed in with sharpie while he is left blank. Despite him no longer being physically present, I still feel him with me, hence why he is shown hugging me, but also through the different things that remind me of him, which is why he is transforming into them: the trees, birds, and lilies.</p>

                    <p>This picture very clearly relates to my topic because the entire piece is about my grandpa. My topic is about my grandpa and our memories together and this piece is the magnum opus of what our relationship meant/means to me. As for what it says about me, well, I think it shows that I love and care about my grandpa, which is true. I mean, there's a reason why I keep talking about him after all these years.</p>
                        
                    <p>(Fun Fact: This piece was actually a homework assignment for DES 15 where we had to create something that transforms into something else and is colored with the colors of the color wheel.)</p>
                    
                    <h3>Part Two</h3>
                    <img src="images/shey-photo.jpg" alt="Shey's Photo">
                    <figcaption>created by Shay Sevey</figcaption>
                    <p>For this image exchange, I traded photos with Shay Sevey. The image Shay sent me is a photo of her doodles, which I know because I've seen her doodles before. This specific photo seems to be a collage of three separate doodles drawn in different parts of her notebook. For me the most interesting part of this image is the pens used to draw them. All of the sketches have a red or pink marker as a prominent feature of the doodles, but you can also see other lines from pencil sketches or ballpoint pens used in some of the doodles, which give them another dimension besides the pink marker. The most obvious part of the doodles is that they were drawn by Shay, but the most mysterious part, for me at least, is the context of why they were drawn. Were they just some doodles she drew out of boredom or were they intentionally drawn for a project she was working on? What is the backstory of these characters? Are these common characters she likes to draw or were they something new she was trying out for the moment?</p> 

                    <h3>Shay's Analysis of my Photo</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>I think there are lots of different interpretations I can gather from this image but the ones that stick out the most for me would be a relationship with a guardian or parental  figure and how it evolves and changes. The parental figure might be getting older or has already passed away, and the shadows depict the memory of all years before, showing bond is still there always.</li>
                        <li>The most interesting aspect in this piece has to be the figures in the shadows. This portrayal gives us the best clues about what the relationship between the two figures is. The second biggest aspect is that the older figure is seemingly changing, fading, and flying away.</li>
                        <li>Most obvious aspect would be the showing of a theme of a family tie and letting go. The most mysterious is figuring out exactly who or what happened with this connection and the symbolism of the colors and the fading away.</li>

                    <h2>Visual Thinking</h2>
                    <time datetime="2023-10-25">October 25, 2023</time>
                    <p>The topic of visual thinking is a pretty interesting one for me as it is something I unconsciously try to do. The main idea of visual thinking is taking a picture or art work and trying to analyze it openly to either try to figure out what it means or what moment it captures. It is meant to be a type of exercise/activity to expand someone's mind and have them think more creatively, as to say.</p>

                    <p>As I mentioned before, this is something I already try to practice on my own. I did not know this was an exercise to expand someone's mind, so I just did it because I was curious about the picture itself. A lot of thought is put into the composition of a photo or an art piece and you can't get the full meaning or intention of it through a quick glance, so I often analyze the picture like it's done through visual thinking. I think another aspect of visual thinking that I think is cool is its storytelling. By using visual thinking, you are able to not only get a narrative but also create a narrative. It's a cool concept that can be seen in things like storyboarding and graphic novels, and it's a power people often forget they have.</p>

                    <h2>Overlay Guidelines</h2>
                    <time datetime="2023-10-23">October 23, 2023</time>
                    <p>I found the guidelines <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Medium</a> gave about overlays very helpful in how to style them and how to properly use them. I think a reason why I found them so helpful is because some of the things they suggested to do are or to avoid are some of the things that irritate me when they are not followed. The biggest example of this would be the suggestion to make them user-initiated. I absolutely hate it when a website suddenly gives me a pop-up out of nowhere as it disturbs the flow of the site and also gets me out of the moment. This is especially true when the close button is hard to locate and is just stuck there until I find it. Both of these problems are things that Medium suggests against and it's understandable too. The design and flow of the website should keep the user in mind and be user-centric. When a random pop-up appears and the close button is hard to find, it eliminates the user's agency and makes the site less user-centric.

                    <h2>Form Design Research</h2>
                    <time datetime="2023-10-15">October 15, 2023</time>
                    <p>I agree with the tips given by the <em>Medium</em> article "<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>." All of these tips, from what questions to start out with to where to place the labels and example texts, are all things that help people fill forms out, and in fact are tips that I gave to my work once before. For context, I work as a computer room consultant (CRC) and in order to get promoted we have to take a test. The majority of the test was taken through a Google form and, in my opinion, was not well formatted. The test was too long and was all in one page. Although the questions were divided into sections, they did not divide them into different pages and overloaded us with too much information with no clear indication when that test was going to end.</p>

                    <p>I think that the form I filled out the best exemplifies these practices was the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> sign up page. It started out simple with just asking your email, to begin to create your account, and then your personal information. Afterwards, it starts to ask questions about your career and what you are looking for, but also gives you the option to skip that process and fill it in later.</p>
